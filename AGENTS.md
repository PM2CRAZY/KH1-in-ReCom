# AGENTS.md: KH1 combat in Re:Chain of Memories

Read first, every session:

1. `docs/design-philosophy-instructions.md`
2. `docs/engineering-rules.md`
3. `docs/tester-requests.md` (its rules win if they differ)
4. The top ~15 stages below.

Work only on branch `testing`. Stages are newest first.

## Stage 20: the stance idle after Guard and Counterattack in the field, version 0.8.1 (2026-10-31)

> "when sora guards out of combat, the animation needs to smoothly go into the correct idle"
> (owner's video: the Guard ends in the battle crouch, then the field idle pops in)

- Re:CoM's idle choice `0x1401E6AC0`: the stance idle (row 0x2A, `p001_031`) in battle stance,
  or when the previous or current row is 0x24–0x25 or a swing row 0x30–0x33 (or the current row
  is 0x2A); else the field idle (row 1). Checked (decomp).
- Our KH1-only rows (Guard, Counterattack, appended after 0x47) end in the battle stance like
  Re:CoM's swings, but the rule didn't count them, so a field Guard went to the field idle.
  `rows::row_for` now counts them as swing rows. Test added.
- Not seen in game.

## Stage 19: Keyblades at the KH1 setting, step 1 (owning and equipping), version 0.8.0 (2026-10-31)

> "a. Besides soul eater, every other keyblade should be from KH2 … incorporated NATIVELY in this
> camp menu along with the KH1 keyblades" / unlock: "Ever earned" / Soul Eater: "Not for Sora" /
> Riku's story: "Hide" / menu: "New camp entry" (decision 25)

- Asset step: `kh1-stats.json` format 3 adds `keyblades` (the 17 KH1 Keyblades with Re:CoM
  cards, by Re:CoM card kind 1..0x11, from KH1's weapon table: radius, reach, Strength, crit,
  priority, magic) and `sora_base_strength` (without a Keyblade). Checked (files: Kingdom Key and
  Ultima Weapon rows; names matched by KH1's item order and stats, Assumption for the names).
- Runtime: the equipped Keyblade's KH1 numbers drive the blade test, the damage and Strength.
  It is one byte at `save + 0x2674` (`*(u64*)0x14087B110`), a range of Re:CoM's save block no
  code uses, which Re:CoM saves, checksums and zeroes itself (`recom-cards-save.md`). 0 = the
  Kingdom Key. Checked (decomp + exe scan); the log checks the range on real saves.
- Camp menu: an 8th entry "Keyblades" (KH1 setting, Sora's story, below Settings), through
  wrappers on the camp update `0x1400D9C80`, the entry build `0x1400E3DE0`, the cursor set
  `0x1400DEA10` and the teardown `0x1400D7C20` (all-or-nothing). Its page runs in Re:CoM's Config
  states 0x4A..0x4C, built from Re:CoM's classes after the Status page `0x1400EB7E0`. Unlocked =
  Re:CoM's "ever obtained" state `0x14015B3F0` (normal or premium); names from Re:CoM's card
  names (`0x140164CA0`). Details and addresses: `docs/recom-keyblade-equip.md`.
- Owner's screenshot: the 8th entry has room at Re:CoM's spacing (y ≈ 507 of 720).
- Assumptions: object ownership on delete; the equipped mark (Re:CoM's row marker 0x1D); the
  header title; the spare range on real saves. Not seen in game.

## Stage 18: KH1's lunge distance uses the enemy's body radius, version 0.7.5 (2026-10-31)

> "a then b then c" (owner: (a) the lunge distance, (b) KH1 hurtboxes on twins, (c) the
> equipped Keyblade's size)

- Finding (`hitbox-compare.md`): KH1's ground picker (`0x1402A7320`) subtracts each kind-0 lock
  point's radius (`0x1402B04C0`: point `+0xC` × actor `+0x40`) before its 180 / 300 thresholds.
  The mod used 0, so at 3.00–3.30 m from a Shadow it swung in place and missed where KH1 lunges.
  Checked (decomp).
- Asset step: `kh1-stats.json` format 2 adds each twin's lock radius from its `.mdls` part 4
  (`CLS\x03` lock points, kind = byte 0 & 0xF). Checked (files): all 31 twins have one;
  Shadow 30, Soldier 35, Large Body 100. The Screwdiver has four (170, 40, 40, 40); the first is
  used (Assumption).
- Runtime: Re:CoM's attack target becomes KH1's part with that radius (`win/attack.rs`
  `attack_target`). Data only; no new hook.
- Assumption: the twin's actor scale is 1.0. Not seen in game.

---

## Stage 17: the Keyblade appears on Guard, version 0.7.4 (2026-10-31)

> "when sora doesnt have his keyblade out and does guard, the keyblade should appear"

- The Guard start calls Re:CoM's own "draw the Keyblade", `0x1401F5D30(Sora, 1)` (Sora's
  vtable `+0xF8`, as the swing init `0x1401F0F70` calls it). It plays `kb_appear` only when the
  blade was put away. Re:CoM's own rules put it away again. New byte-checked callee. Checked
  (exe + decomp).
- Owner's trace 10 (0.7.2): 2 of 4 Guards blocked. The 2 that didn't were hit on Guard frame 4
  (startup) and frame 55 (after the motion), outside KH1's live frames 10–36. Checked (trace +
  files). The window stays KH1's.
- Owner: Sora is at max level, so the 300-damage hits (KH1's cap, Strength 51) are right.
- Assumption: KH1's Sora always holds the Keyblade. Not built; to ask.
- Not seen in game.

---

## Stage 16: KH1 model writer, the flip test's step 1, version 0.7.3 (2026-10-30)

> "would it not be easier to just bring all the maps and unique enemies/bosses into KH1 as a mod
> for KH1?" / option (b): "b" (owner, twice: scope it, then run the decisive test)

- Notes: `docs/flip-feasibility.md` (the scope) and `docs/kh1-model-writer.md` (this stage).
- `kh1-formats`:
  - `mobj.rs`: whole `.mdls` files read and written (container, `MOBJ`, both models, PS2
    packets, weighted vertices, textures). Every size, count and offset is rebuilt.
  - `cvbl.rs`: the PC's HD meshes (`.cvbl`) read and written.
  - `egs.rs`: `decode_entry_full` (an entry with its HD assets), `build_plain_entry` (a plain
    entry for Panacea's `<mod_path>/kh1/raw/` route), `Archive::read_raw_entry`,
    `Install::read_full`; `KeyTable::decrypt_head` is public.
- `kh1-recom-assets`: `flip.rs` and the CLI `kh1-flip-test` (`roundtrip`, `install rebuild |
  big | remove`).
- Results: byte-exact on the owner's install, 500 of 500 `.mdls` and 941 of 941 `.cvbl`, and
  every rebuilt entry decodes back (run on the owner's PC through the device link). Checked
  (files). The Shadow's `rebuild` and `big` (×1.5 positions) entries are on the owner's PC.
- Facts found: the PC draws the `.cvbl` HD mesh, not the PS2 packets; HD textures are tagged by
  `.mdls` texture offsets; the block after `MOBJ` holds `_KN5` / `BONE` / `URSL` data; offsets
  past the end of a `.mdls` point at the end rounded up to 0x80. Checked (files + source).
- Assumptions: Panacea's raw route works for KH1 models; the 12 extra inflated bytes of five
  Halloween Town `-1c2.dds` are never read.
- No change to the DLL or to Re:CoM. Not seen in game: `testers/kh1-flip-model/thread.md`.
- Windows type-check not run locally (the Windows target can't be downloaded in this session);
  the DLL doesn't use the changed crates, and the build bot builds and tests the workspace.

## Stage 15: sounds for Guard, its success and the Counterattack, version 0.7.2 (2026-10-30)

> "guard and counterattack work on soras end, lets try to get their sounds working go ahead" /
> sound source: "Re:CoM's sounds now"

- Asset step:
  - `PL0001.SES` is Re:CoM's sound file plus entries for `p001_225` (Guard: whoosh 1236 and
    swing grunts at 0) and `p001_226` (Counterattack: whoosh 1237 and finisher grunts at 0,
    steps at 46 and 80).
  - The KH1 frames are from `xa_ex_0010.mset`. SES frames are 60 Hz motion frames
    (`0x1401A47C0`, 50 ticks a frame).
  - Re:CoM's 50 entries are byte for byte. Checked (files + decomp).
- Runtime: at a guard success, Re:CoM's own guard spark and clink, `0x1401A6B20(Sora,
  "always", 0xB, hit point, 0, 0.0f)` (as `0x140182260` does for enemies). The hit point is
  `player+0x6C0`, kept by the damage-check wrapper. New byte-checked callee `0x1401A6B20`; the
  name pointer `0x1407C2C40` is checked against `"always"` at run time. Checked (exe + decomp).
- Assumptions:
  - The Guard whoosh and voice are the nearest Re:CoM sounds (KH1's weapon + 0xD and clip 24
    have no known Re:CoM match).
  - The id of `always` #0xB's clink is unknown.
  - Re:CoM fades motion sounds on the next motion; KH1 appears not to.
- Also: the replay tool's ability map runs without Counterattack (its bit isn't mapped). A
  stale doc line about the world address was fixed.
- Not seen in game.

---

## Stage 14: KH1 Guard blocks, its recoil, and the Counterattack, version 0.7.1 (2026-10-30)

> "Go ahead and" (owner, after "I'll start on Guard"); decision 20 (KH1 for Sora's side; new
> Re:CoM enemy reactions behind a toggle, next version)

- KH1's rules (`docs/recom-kh1-attack.md` § Guard): guard object live on frames 10–36; kind-6
  success `0x14029D720`; Counterattack offered from frame 12 of request 0x6E (`0x140294220`,
  `0x140293480`), row 0x3E. Checked (decomp + files).
- Re:CoM side: Sora's body guard `player+0x72C` bit 0 and `+0x740` = 100° while live; the
  guarded bit `+0x72C & 0x20` read in the damage-check wrapper; flag 0x80 as `+0x418 & 1`; the
  recoil plays Re:CoM's row 0x24 (`p001_081`, KH1 entry 72's bake); the Counterattack plays the
  KH1-only clip `p001_226` through a second appended action row (`rows::KH1_ONLY`) and a KH1 row
  0x3E in the attack table. Checked (decomp).
- kh1-core: motion 0x6E (entry 72: 60 frames, free 28–60, window 28–60), the Counterattack
  ability bit, a `GuardSucceeded` event. The oracle's controller has no clash yet; the handler
  tests check KH1's numbers directly.
- ini: `counterattack = on` (default).
- Not seen in game. Enemy reactions (decision 20's toggle) are the next version.

---

## Stage 13: KH1 damage and HP on Re:CoM's enemies, Sora's KH1 Strength, version 0.7.0 (2026-10-30)

> "Yes do that order, and have it follow the Rod" / Strength path: "Rod, give up Shield" /
> enemy stats: "Same world, LV1"

- **Strength** (decision 18): new game btltbl `0x39D8` (Sora Strength 4), Dive deltas
  `0x128 + 4 × choice` (keep Rod, give up Shield: +0), level bonuses `0x3AC0` (bonus 4 =
  Strength +2, `0x1402B51B0` → `0x1402B5660`), Kingdom Key +3 (`0x1402A5130`). 7 at level 1 … 51
  at 99. Checked (decomp + files).
- **Enemy records** (decisions 12, 21): KH1's AI syscall 45 records, read by the asset step
  from each twin's `.mdls` part 5 at the script offsets found by evaluating the scripts (per
  world for the Shadow, LV1 / LV2 for the rest). 31 Re:CoM classes. Checked (decomp + files).
  Pairings by internal name only: Assumption, tagged in the file.
- **Runtime** (`win/stats.rs`, new hooks `0x14017FF50` enemy stats init and `0x14017F5A0` max HP;
  callees `0x1402339C0` world, `0x1401AAAE0` Riku's story; all byte-checked): KH1 HP on twins,
  KH1 damage written as the hit part's value `+0x92` in the enemy hit handler, then Re:CoM's own
  weak-part / resistance / falloff. Sora's level from `*0x14087CBF8 + 0x1C`. Riku's story and
  classes without a twin keep Re:CoM's numbers. Checked (decomp); not seen in game.
- **Swing aim**: KH1 keeps the yaw taken at the press (`0x1402A7510` → `0x1402A38E0`). The mod
  already does this. Checked (decomp).
- Decisions 19–21 recorded. Guard (decision 20) and M6 are the next versions.
- Assumption: Re:CoM's damage path adds nothing else to the value (`0x14015D5F0` can rewrite
  AP; not read). The log names each class's KH1 HP / Defence per world the first time.

---

## Stage 12: Re:CoM's ledge grab from a KH1 jump, version 0.6.3 (2026-10-30)

> "sora is also unable to ledge grab with KH1 selected"

- Addresses: the jump exe `0x1401EDA60` (hooked since Stage 8). Its ledge tail is at
  `0x1401EE0E6..0x1401EE109`: the wall climb check `0x1401E8C00(pl, 1)`, the climb init
  `0x1401F2C20(pl, n)` when the result is above 1, the hang check `0x1401E8420(pl)`, and an
  inline hang block. That block makes the same writes and calls as `0x1401F26A0` (action 9,
  row 0xF). Checked (disasm + decomp).
- Cause: at KH1 setting our hook ran the KH1 air frame in place of Re:CoM's jump exe, so the
  ledge tail never ran (decision 16 keeps Re:CoM's ledges). Checked (decomp).
- Change: after the KH1 air frame, the hook calls those Re:CoM functions under Re:CoM's
  conditions: action 7, rising or falling, and not landing this frame. Re:CoM's hang, climb
  and drop then run as its own actions 9 / 0x10. Four new callee checks with the Steam bytes
  (`sites::MOVE_CALLEES`). The ground ledge checks already ran, because the original move exe
  runs on the ground. Checked (decomp).
- Assumption: a jump or drop from the hang goes through our jump init and continues as a KH1
  jump or fall. Not seen in game yet. The log says "movement: Re:CoM's ledge hang/climb started
  from a KH1 jump" the first time each happens.
- Also, from the owner's 0.6.1 traces 7–8 (no code change): the position jump is fixed. The
  "missing swings" are KH1's own press rules: presses before the combo window, and presses
  after a swing that hit nothing. Details in `docs/recom-kh1-attack.md` § In game, 0.6.1.
  Checked (trace + decomp).

---

## Stage 11: mod version on the Combat row's help line, version 0.6.2 (2026-10-30)

> "also make it so hovering over the recom/kh1 config option shows the mod version as well"

- Address: the help line `camp+0x9D0`, set with `0x140259000` by our Config draw hook
  (`0x1400DF1B0`), unchanged since Stage 6. Checked (decomp).
- Change: the Combat row's help text now ends with "(mod v<version>)". The version comes from
  `crates/kh1-recom/Cargo.toml` at build time, so it is the same as the log's first line. The
  text stays static, NUL-terminated ASCII with no `%`, so `0x140259000` keeps the pointer as
  before. A unit test checks the suffix. Checked (test).
- Assumption: the longer line (82 characters) fits the help box without being cut off. Not
  seen in game yet.
- Also in this build: the 0.6.1 swing / guard / roll fix (Stage 10). The owner's 0.6.0
  retest (traces 3-6) ran 0.6.0, because the DLL installed on the PC was copied before the
  build bot had built 0.6.1. Those traces show the Stage 10 fault in all 9 moves (attack:
  action 0xA; guard: action 6 sub 1; roll: action 6 sub 0), and the Stage 10 hook covers
  actions 6 and 0xA. Checked (trace).

---

## Stage 10: fix the swing / roll position jump, version 0.6.1 (2026-10-30)

> "sora cant do his ground combo, it either makes him jump or teleport or just jitter
> uncontrollably. this also happens in the field" / "something similar happens with dodge roll as
> well"

- Owner's traces (`testers/recom-attack/owner-0.6.0-attack-*.csv`): on the Attack press, Sora's
  position jumped from the floor at (−416, −750, 1364) to (10.6, −597, −34.7), 153 units below
  the floor. He then free-fell until Re:CoM's out-of-bounds handler respawned him; a press while
  falling gave air row 18. Checked (trace).
- Root cause: the root-motion hook at `0x14024DCA0`. That function returns an absolute position
  (`ctrl+0xF0` + this update's rotated travel, via `0x14024C960`), and the entity task sets
  `P + mask∘(out − P)`. Our one-update delay treated the return value as a travel, so the first
  update of a swing or roll returned (0, 0, 0). Checked (decomp + trace).
- Fix: the hook delays only `out − anchor` and returns `anchor + last travel`. If ours differs
  from Re:CoM's by more than 0.5 m, Re:CoM's stands. It passes through when the frame counter isn't
  running.
- Regression test: swing and roll away from the origin keep Sora's position; travel = KH1's 100.
- New ini key `debug_attack = on` logs the first 200 attack decisions.
- Not yet seen in game.

---

## Stage 9: KH1 Attack inside Re:CoM (M5), spring fix, version 0.6.0 (2026-10-30)

> M5 per the roadmap, plus the owner's report on 0.5.0: "sora needs to be able to jump as high as
> he is supposed to on these springs"

- **Springs:**
  - Re:CoM's jump init launches springs: gimmick `0x2002`, `0x1401E80C0(pl, 0x2002) == 7`,
    ability `+0x41C & 0x20000`, speed from `0x1405A0100` (39–75.8 against a normal 28),
    `+0x418 |= 0x1000000`, row 0x14.
  - Every KH1 ground jump now runs Re:CoM's spring test first. On a spring, Re:CoM's own jump runs
    until landing, then KH1's rules resume. Checked (decomp); not yet seen in game.
- **KH1 Attack** at `combat = kh1` (`docs/recom-kh1-attack.md`):
  - In battle, the confirm press takes Re:CoM's field (cardless) branch, and the use-card button
    is skipped.
  - initAttack becomes the field-swing init. kh1-core's picker chooses the row in Sora's vtable
    slot `+0x128` (`0x1405A9A60`).
  - Our wrapper on the field swing exe runs KH1's combo window, chain, facing and air arc, then
    Re:CoM's exe.
  - Battle jump-table entry `0x1401FA074` points action 0xA at a 13-byte stub in the int3 gap at
    `0x1401FA6C1` (15 free bytes, lead-checked).
  - KH1 rows in Re:CoM's layout reuse Re:CoM's clips 1–7, with KH1's hit and combo windows (flag
    0x80) and no 20-frame lockout.
  - KH1's two-sphere blade plus sweep (radius 0.40 m), tested with Re:CoM's own primitives.
  - Card priority: a KH1 hit interrupts the enemy's card through Re:CoM's `0x2000001` path.
  - Reactions: swings flinch (kind 1), finishers knock away (kind 2).
  - ini: `combo_plus`, `air_combo_plus`, `combo_master`.
  - Hooks also on `0x1401F8150`, `0x1401E8FF0`, `0x1401F0D90`, `0x1401F0F70`, `0x1401EAEB0`,
    `0x14016EAD0`, `0x14017F7E0`, `0x1401E6DE0` and `0x14024DCA0`. 54 sites byte-checked.
- **M4 follow-ups:**
  - High Jump plays Re:CoM's rows 0x14/0x15.
  - Root motion is one update late for Sora (the roll is now exact against kh1-core).
  - **Finding:** KH1's roll has no untouchable frames. The `0x2B`/`0x2A` ops are only queued by
    event scripts, so roll protection = 12 no-flinch frames, damage still taken. This corrects
    KH2-Combat-in-KH1's `kh1-intangible.md`. Checked (decomp).
- **Damage:**
  - Still Re:CoM's (logged FALLBACK). KH1 enemy stats come from 0x6C-byte records passed by an AI
    script call (syscall 45, `0x1402BBDF0` → `0x1402A58E0`). Strength/Defence index a 21-row table
    at btltbl `0xC8A8`. Checked (decomp + files).
  - The per-enemy records are in KH1's enemy script files, not read yet.
- **Not done:** Guard repel / Counterattack (Re:CoM's guard fields at `player+0x690` found, not
  wired); MP charge (needs the enemy's KH1 level).
- 1:1, Checked (tests vs kh1-core): ground 13→11→8, missed-swing refusal, air 18→17→16, landing
  cutting an air swing, jump beating Attack, the roll.
- Assumptions: hit window one frame earlier (Re:CoM's hit test runs after the animation update);
  the target aim point stands in for KH1's body part. Nothing seen in game yet; tester thread
  `testers/recom-attack/thread.md`.

---

## Stage 8: KH1 movement inside Re:CoM's player actions (M4), version 0.5.0 (2026-10-30)

> "looks good enough for now, lets work on phase 2"

- At `combat = kh1`, for the main `CPlayerSora` only (Riku untouched), Re:CoM's own movement
  actions run KH1's rules and numbers (`docs/recom-kh1-movement.md`):
  - actions 2/3/4 are ground movement, 6 Dodge Roll / Guard, 7 take-off / air / landing, 8 glide;
  - Re:CoM still plays the animations, applies root motion, moves and collides Sora.
- Hooks, all byte-checked and all-or-nothing (39 site byte lists re-checked against the exe):
  - move exe `0x1401EEDA0`, stick class `0x1401E9630`, move step `0x1401EF3C0`;
  - jump init `0x1401F29F0`, avoid init `0x1401F10C0`, jump exe `0x1401EDA60`;
  - Sora avoid exe `0x140217310`, Sora glide exe `0x140217B50`;
  - trace-only hooks on Field / Battle exes (one flag test while not recording).
- Units, Checked (exe + decomp):
  - KH1 (x, y, z) cm, y down = Re:CoM (x, −y, −z)/100 m, y up;
  - KH1 yaw ψ = Re:CoM π − ψ;
  - Re:CoM's `+0x464` = dt × 0.02 (60 Hz frames);
  - Re:CoM's jump peaks at 1.92 m at frame 28, KH1's at 190 units at frame 28.
- Animations follow decision 11: Re:CoM's rows, plus three appended rows for the KH1-only High Jump,
  its apex, and Guard (from the asset manifest).
- Abilities in `kh1-recom.ini` (`high_jump`, `glide`, `superglide`, `dodge_roll`, `guard`).
- F9 Re:CoM trace in the kh1-trace schema.
- 1:1, Checked (tests) against kh1-core frame for frame. Known: the Dodge Roll moves one frame
  early (same distance and end point), and follow-on animations start one frame late (the lock
  releases on KH1's frame).
- Owner decisions recorded this stage (design doc 12–15): KH1 damage formula with KH1-twin stats;
  keep Re:CoM's hit extras; KH1 card priority (hits land); enemy cards hidden.
- Not checked in game. Tester thread `testers/recom-movement/thread.md`.

## Stage 7: Config window border fits the Combat row, version 0.4.2 (2026-10-30)

> Owner's 0.4.1 screenshots: the fill reached below "Combat" but the border stopped at "Game
> Mode". The help line on Combat was right.

- Re:CoM's 9-slice (`0x14024C270` / `0x14024AD40`) only handles sprites with exactly 9 parts. The
  panel's border and highlight are 8-part sprites, so the earlier bottom offset never reached
  them. Checked (disasm).
- Fix: at the same open/close points, nothing per frame:
  - each border part below the sprite's middle gets its own copy of its shared sprite-set rect,
    moved down 26 units;
  - this moves the bottom corners and edge and stretches the sides;
  - Re:CoM re-reads the rect each update (`0x14024B380`), so it then draws the frame itself.
  - The shared data isn't changed.
- In game (owner's 0.4.1 screenshot): the Combat row works: cursor, highlight, and the help text
  fits on one line. The border fix hasn't been seen yet.

---

## Stage 6: owner's animation rule, Config panel fit, version 0.4.1 (2026-10-30)

- Asset step (`kh1-recom-assets`, new `matching.rs`): each KH1 entry is matched against Re:CoM's
  clips at their key frames on all 135 bones.
  - 39 are bakes: every bone ≤0.9° and ≤1 mm; worst 0.74°, the four known pairs <0.02°.
  - 10 are Re:CoM edits: ≤20 bones differ, no other owner.
  - The closest wrong pair is 17 bones; the closest clip for a KH1-only entry is 26 bones.
  - Matches all 46 of `clip_origin`'s pairs, plus 0→p001_001, 65→p001_043, 78→p001_157.
    Checked (files, tests).
  - Only the 69 KH1-only entries get new slots (161–229). `PL0001.ANN` is 10.0 MB and `PL0002.ANN`
    0.84 MB. `kh1-motions.json` maps all 118 KH1 entries to the Re:CoM slot that plays them.
- DLL:
  - The "KH1 motions test" row, its ini key and the action-table row swap are removed. An old ini
    line is ignored.
  - Config panel: in the existing draw hook, Re:CoM's own 9-slice (`C2DSprObj`, vtable
    `0x1406077D8`, corner offsets `+0xA0..+0xAC`, flag 8 at `+0x144`, applied in `0x14024AD40`) is
    given one extra row of bottom offset. Checked (decomp); that the panel art is a 9-part sprite is
    an Assumption, and the log reports it.
- In game (owner's screenshot of 0.4.0): our rows render with Re:CoM's own buttons, font and value
  highlights. The panel was one frame short, which is what this stage fixes. Not yet seen in game.

## Stage 5: Phase 1 in Re:CoM: KH1 motions asset step, motion switch, Config rows, version 0.4.0 (2026-10-30)

> "lets finish phase 1" (ROADMAP M2 + M3)

- **Asset step** (`crates/kh1-recom-assets`, CLI `kh1-recom-build`; `docs/kh1-recom-assets.md`):
  - Converts all 118 KH1 Sora motions (via `kh1-anim`) into new 60 fps slots 161–278 of Re:CoM's
    `PLAYER/0001/PL0001.ANN`, and the matching Keyblade clips into `PLAYER/0002/PL0002.ANN`.
    Re:CoM's own slots stay byte-identical.
  - Writes `<mod_path>\Recom\…` plus `kh1-motions.json`. Panacea serves files from
    mod_path + "/recom" by archive path. Checked (OpenKH Panacea source).
  - Validation: Re:CoM pack decode → encode is byte-identical; converted clips match KH1's pose
    ≤0.045 mm / 0.005° per frame. Against Square Enix's own bakes they are ≤0.019° (body) and
    ≤0.007° (Keyblade, entry 98). Checked (files, tests).
  - Known: the Keyblade tip `k9` is off by 1.58° in entry 4 (KH1 bone 283's copy-orientation
    constraint in `kh1-anim`), and by 0.18° in entry 74.
  - Loader: no 161-slot limit; sizes come from the file (`0x14029F3A0`), and the name lookup
    (`0x1401A47E0` / `0x1402A42B0`) handles slots ≥161. Checked (decomp).
- **DLL** (`crates/kh1-recom`; `docs/recom-config-menu.md`, `docs/recom-motion-switch.md`):
  - Hook infrastructure: byte-checked, all-or-nothing. Starts from Panacea's `OnInit`.
  - Config: two rows, "Combat: Re:CoM / KH1" and "KH1 motions test: Off / On", added to the camp
    menu's Config screen using Re:CoM's own item, layout, cursor and help code. Hooks: Config input
    `0x1400D3EB0` (`48 89 5C 24 08 57 48 83 EC 20`) and draw `0x1400DF1B0`
    (`48 8B C4 55 41 54 41 55 41 56`). Bytes re-checked by the lead against the exe.
  - The values are saved in `kh1-recom.ini`: the Config save has no byte that can be proven free.
  - `config_menu = off` is a safety switch.
  - The KH1 motions test repoints 12 name pointers in Sora's action table (`0x1407C5E80`): idle,
    walk, run, swings 1–2, lunge, finisher. Re:CoM resolves and plays them itself from the next
    room load. Data only, nothing per frame.
- Not checked in game: the rows' look and behaviour, the clips playing, the Keyblade following.
  Tester thread `testers/recom-phase1/thread.md`.

## Stage 4: KH1 trace logger, replay and diff (M1), version 0.3.0 (2026-10-30)

> "lets finish phase 1" (ROADMAP M1)

- `crates/kh1-trace` (`docs/kh1-trace.md`):
  - `kh1-trace.dll` for KH1 FM Steam. Build check: PE time stamp `0x669E37CE`, size
    `0x2F91000`.
  - One hook on the per-actor task `0x140297FE0` (`48 8B C4 57 48 83 EC 60`). F9 records
    `kh1-trace-<n>.csv` with about 70 columns: state, motion, position, velocities, combo, and the
    inputs.
  - `kh1-tracediff` compares two traces.
- Playground: `--replay <csv>` feeds the recorded inputs to the controller and diffs the result.
  Replay is deterministic byte for byte (tests).
- Finding: KH1's "ground contact" is +0x2D0 bit 0, not bit 1. Checked (decomp).
- Assumptions: the camera yaw formula (checked against KH1's own move vector on real traces); Sora
  is party slot 0; Panacea calls `OnInit` before frames run.
- Not run in KH1 yet. Tester thread `testers/kh1-traces/thread.md`.

## Stage 3: smoother Sora in the playground, PS5 controllers, version 0.2.1 (2026-10-30)

> "lets make the actual character model looking smoother, and make sure ps5 controllers work with
> it" (owner chose a smoother mannequin, not the real mesh)

- `kh1-playground/src/body.rs` replaces the old one-capsule-per-bone figure:
  - smooth tapered limbs (two spheres joined by a cone, with smooth normals) and rounded joints;
  - the pelvis, chest, head and shoes are ellipsoids oriented by the surrounding bones;
  - Sora's 14 real hair spikes, jacket tails, hood and fingers follow their own bones;
  - MSAA ×4, plus a fill light.
- The KH1 bone roles come from matching KH1's skeleton to Re:CoM's named one, e.g. 17/18/20/23 for
  the right leg and 93/94/97/100 for the right arm. Checked (files).
- **Finding:** KH1 doesn't pose the end bones of chains (flags `0x6000000`: hair tips, jacket
  tails, hood). The figure places them from the parent's world matrix and the end bone's rest
  translation. Checked (files: idle pose dump).
- Gamepads:
  - Bevy's gilrs uses Windows.Gaming.Input with SDL's controller database, which includes the
    DualSense `054C:0CE6` and the Edge `0DF2` over USB and Bluetooth (gilrs builds USB-style
    GUIDs). Checked (crate source; the mapping string is in the built exe).
  - The HUD shows each pad's name, ids, stick and held buttons, with PS labels.
  - Not tested with a real pad.
- No change to the rewrite crates or the Re:CoM DLL, apart from the version number.

## Stage 2: KH1 battle system Rust rewrite + playground demo, version 0.2.0 (2026-10-30)

> "Lets try to do a full 1:1 Rust Rewrite of the KH1 Battle System, similar to how we did the KH2
> battle system rewrite, with a demo i can test" (owner: reference + demo; first demo movement +
> Attack)

- New crates (`docs/kh1-rewrite.md`):
  - `kh1-formats`: reads PC HED/PKG and KH1's `.mset`, `.mdls` and `btltbl.bin`.
  - `kh1-anim`: KH1's posing pass (curves, start pose, constraints, two-bone IK, frozen-snapshot
    blends).
  - `kh1-core`: the 60 Hz controller and combat.
  - `kh1-data`: install discovery and `SoraKit`.
  - `kh1-playground`: Bevy demo.
- Data is read at runtime from the player's `kh1_first.pkg` (`xa_ex_0010.mset/.mdls`,
  `btltbl.bin`). Checked (files: decoding gives the extracted files' SHA-256).
- `kh1-anim` matches Square Enix's own Re:CoM bakes of the same KH1 motions to ≤0.019° local
  rotation and ≤0.051 mm world position on swing / roll / run / jump. Checked (files, tests).
- `kh1-core` corrections to the notes (cone 22°, air row 17 above, combo 13→14→8 with a close
  target, …) are in `docs/kh1-sora.md`. Checked (decomp).
- Assumptions are marked in the code and the HUD: root travel subtraction, MSVC `rand`, task order,
  dummy stats (Strength 5, Defence 2, 300 HP), and the camera (an orbit camera, not KH1's).
- Headless check: a scripted combo runs rows 13 → 14 → 8 and hits the close dummy for 3, 3 and 7.
- The `kh1-recom` DLL is unchanged apart from its version (0.2.0); it still only checks the game.
- 70 tests (all pass with `KH1_TEST_DATA`); clippy clean.
- Not checked against a KH1 trace yet. Gamepad untested.

## Stage 1: the mod's skeleton DLL, version 0.1.0 (2026-10-30)

> "B, and use whichever is least effort and is most native to RECom" (owner: Panacea loads the
> mod; at KH1 setting Sora plays KH1's motions re-baked at 60 fps)

- New crate `crates/kh1-recom`: a cdylib that OpenKH's Panacea loads (`openkh/mod.yml`, copied as
  `dll/kh1-recom.dll`). On load it starts one thread and then nothing runs per frame:
  - checks the exe is the Steam build: PE time stamp `0x669E38DF`, size of image `0xD4A000`.
    Checked (exe).
  - checks the first 16 bytes of each future hook site. Checked (exe bytes = decomp function
    starts):
    - initAttack `0x1401F0D90`
    - field swing init `0x1401F0F70`
    - player motion request `0x1401F7180`
    - attack row pick `0x1401F7520`
    - Battle exe `0x1401F9840`
    - Field exe `0x1401FA0F0`
    - use-card button `0x1401E8FF0`
    - `.ANN` loader `0x14029F3A0`
  - reads `kh1-recom.ini` (`combat = kh1 | recom`, default `kh1`), writing it if missing. Nothing
    reads the setting yet. The Config-menu toggle is still to do.
  - writes `kh1-recom.log` next to the game.
- **No hooks installed and nothing patched.** The game plays exactly as Re:CoM.
- Panacea knows Re:CoM: its `DBGHELP.dll` names the Re:CoM exe, uses a `/recom` mod subfolder, and
  hooks Re:CoM's `Axa::CFileMan`. Checked (files: strings in the owner's Panacea DLL). Whether it
  loads `dll/*.dll` for Re:CoM as it does for KH1: Assumption, to check with the first launch.
- Build: MinGW cross-compile (`tools/build-win.sh`); build bot `.github/workflows/build.yml`
  commits `openkh/kh1-recom.dll` on `testing`. 7 unit tests.
- Not checked in game yet: that Panacea loads the DLL, and the log on the owner's machine.

## Stage 0: groundwork (2026-10-29)

> "Where I'd start: a cardless Attack, built into Re:CoM's own battle code. Before that comes a
> short groundwork step (step 0)."

No code. `VERSION` not created yet; the first change under `crates/` starts it.

- Repo seeded: these rules files, `docs/sources.md`.
- Re:CoM Steam decomp made (see `docs/sources.md`). Checked (exe): SHA-256 `acf42e96…6bbf`.
- Finding: Re:CoM's exe is mixed-mode C++/CLI; the .NET part is only the shell. Checked (exe).
- Finding: the KH1 notes in KH2-Combat-in-KH1 use Epic addresses; convert to Steam before use.
  Checked (files).

Step 0 mapping (2026-10-29, notes only):

- `docs/recom-timing.md`: both games step by a variable delta in 60 Hz frames. Re:CoM uses 50
  units per frame, so KH1 frames × 50 = Re:CoM time. Checked (decomp + exe, both games).
- `docs/recom-player.md`: player state machine (table-driven, 4 states: Field / Battle / Wait /
  Hide), the action switch, and the card path from button to `initAttack`. Checked (decomp).
- `docs/recom-combat.md`: motion request and advance, Sora's attack-row table `0x1407C6C70`, the
  hit path and the damage formula. Checked (decomp; rows read from the exe).
- `docs/recom-battle-entry.md`: field-to-battle handover (separate battle room) and the native
  cardless field swing (action `0xA`, card id 0) that shares battle collision. Checked (decomp).
- Assumption, well supported: Re:CoM's motion system is not KH2's mset system.

Step 0 still to do:

1. Plan the trace tool with the tester: the same fields from both games (tick, state, motion,
   frame, position, velocity, hit events).
2. KH1's side mapped in `docs/kh1-sora.md` (states, movement, jump, glide, roll, guard, motion
   requests, the Attack combo). Still needed: the numbers in KH1's data files (`btltbl.bin`,
   `xa_ex_0010.mset`) and Re:CoM's (`stockskilllist.bin`, `PL0001.ANN`), from the player's
   extracted files.
3. Open, not read yet: the damage veto `0x140180920`, the AP rewrite `0x14015D5F0`, the
   double-hit spawn `0x140158DD0`, and which hit kind the field swing produces on map enemies.
