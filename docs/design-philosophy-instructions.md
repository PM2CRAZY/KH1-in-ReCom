# Design philosophy

A Rust mod (a DLL) that brings Kingdom Hearts 1's combat (Final Mix, PC, Steam build) into
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories (PC, Steam build).

Every setting has a Config-menu toggle between **Re:CoM** and **KH1**.

- With every setting on KH1, the game must feel 1:1 with KH1.
- With every setting on Re:CoM, it must play exactly like Re:CoM.

These rules override any habit of the assistant.

## Native always

Re:CoM's own systems own Sora. Native means giving Re:CoM's engine more abilities so it can do
everything KH1 can, and so KH1 runs 1:1 inside Re:CoM. We add to Re:CoM's own systems:

- new states in its player state table;
- new commands in its command/card dispatcher, including commands that need no card;
- new rows in its attack, hit and damage tables;
- new motion slots;
- new effect programs;
- new sound banks;
- new camera modes;
- new HUD elements drawn by Re:CoM's own HUD code;
- new functions or wrappers patched into Re:CoM's own functions.

Re:CoM then runs the KH1 feature itself: it steps it, draws it, plays it, collides it and ends it.

### Not native

Any KH1 logic of ours that runs beside Re:CoM's and copies its results into Re:CoM's fields is
not native, even if it never takes Sora over. Examples:

- our own KH1 player controller driving Sora;
- fake cards slipped into the deck so KH1 attacks "look like" card plays;
- our own hit sweeps or damage maths;
- our own magic or summon runtime;
- our own HUD or renderer.

That code is "running along" or "deprecated", and every change should move it into Re:CoM's
systems. If something can only run along for now, say so and ask before shipping it that way.
Never offer hybrid versions, and never ask which version to build.

## Build what Re:CoM lacks

If KH1 has a feature Re:CoM doesn't, build it into Re:CoM's engine without asking each time.
Examples:

- MP and the magic menu;
- the command menu with free Attack;
- items and quick slots;
- persistent party members with AI;
- AP and abilities;
- Guard;
- combo finishers;
- KH1 summons;
- KH1's level-up stats.

Ask only about open design choices, and before choosing between native designs that change how
the feature plays.

## 1:1 target

With a setting on KH1, every value matches KH1's exe exactly: timings, frame data, momentum,
speeds, windows, damage, MP costs, camera. No approximating.

- KH1's numbers run inside Re:CoM's engine.
- Confirm both games' tick and animation rates in their decomps before converting frame counts.
  Don't assume they differ, or that they match.
- A feature is 1:1 when the tester's trace matches KH1 frame for frame, or the KH1 decomp
  confirms the numbers. Say which you checked and what you couldn't.
- If a real native attempt still can't match KH1, stop and ask. Say what differs, why, and what
  the native options are.

## Re:CoM stays whole

- Nothing Re:CoM does may break or change because of our work. That includes the features KH1
  never had: cards, card breaks, sleights, Reload, stocking, enemy cards, world/room cards,
  Moogle shops and Reverse/Rebirth.
- Replaced systems must still give Re:CoM's events, scripts, bosses and room logic everything
  they read. Bosses and scripted fights that check card values are the main risk here.
- KH1's and Re:CoM's systems share the same native code wherever they can.
- When a choice strongly affects how the game feels, it becomes a Config toggle, not a silent
  change for everyone. Card breaks against KH1-style attacks are an example.

## Little of ours per frame

- As little of our code as possible runs every frame.
- Prefer data that Re:CoM's own code reads (rows, commands, motion slots, attack data, effect
  programs, sound banks) over per-frame hooks that steer it.
- Measure before proposing a performance fix. Don't trade native integration for a small speed
  win without asking.

## Assets

A build step makes them once, from the player's own extracted KH1 and Re:CoM files, into the
mod folder for Re:CoM to load as its own. Nothing from the games goes in the repo. Plan each
step with the tester first.

## Scope is open-ended

Look in KH1 and Re:CoM for related mechanics nobody mentioned. Examples: KH1's MP regen rules,
combo-ender knockback, Trinity, Donald's and Goofy's AI settings, the lock-on camera, the Scan HP
bar. When you find one, say what it is, where it is, and whether it matters for 1:1 feel, then
ask before adding it.

## Decided by the owner (2026-10-29)

> "the goal is to remove attack cards entirely, and have the card battles be replaced entirely by
> the KH1 combat."

At KH1 setting:

- **Sora in the field** moves and attacks like KH1 Sora, natively, with all his abilities. He is
  not a passthrough.
- **Battle transitions stay Re:CoM's.** Attacking a Heartless in the field, or walking into one,
  puts Sora into the battle arena with it, as in Re:CoM.
- **In the arena, no cards are used.** Sora fights as he does in KH1.
- **Enemies with a KH1 equivalent** (Shadow, for example) act, attack and animate exactly 1:1 as
  in KH1, natively inside Re:CoM's enemy systems.
- The card-value question (2026-10-29) is settled: with no cards in battle, there are no card
  breaks against KH1 attacks.

### Answers (owner, 2026-10-29)

1. Magic, summons and items are replaced by their KH1 equivalents. Those with no equivalent are
   removed for now and listed in `docs/card-replacement.md` for later.
2. Re:CoM-only enemies and bosses: keep their Re:CoM behaviour but without card plays, attacking
   on their own timing (option a), for now.
3. First strike: yes, a KH1 field hit keeps Re:CoM's stun / first-strike bonus into the arena.
4. Party: Donald and Goofy don't appear, for now.
5. Progression: Re:CoM's level-up choices, for now. To be revisited.
6. Riku's story (Reverse/Rebirth) stays as it is, for now.

## Known open design questions (ask the owner, don't guess)

- **Sleights and enemy cards** at KH1 setting (see `docs/card-replacement.md`).
- **Keyblade and stats** at KH1 setting, with no attack cards.
- Revisit later: party, progression.
